# Wild-Series
Projet Symfony 4

## Description

Repository created to learn and improve Symfony 4 during my training in the Wild Code School (Nantes) in December 2019 after three months of code learning.

It is the creation of a web application similar to Betaseries 

I use the Scrum method to realise this project.

Skills :  
HTML5, CSS3, SCSS, Bootstrap,  
PHP, Doctrine,  
Symfony 4, Webpack Encore

Here is the wireframe edited with MokeFlow:

## How to set up the ProjectÂ¶

You only need to get the project code and install the dependencies with Composer.  
And follow this command:

Then run those two commands:
```
yarn install
yarn encore build
```
